What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created which contains the metadata that tracks changes in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's in between. Files in the staging area have been picked from the working directory but not committed into the repository yet.
