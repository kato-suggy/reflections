When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are sharing with other people, or you want to make a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want control over what you are working with in your local repository, especially if other people are working on the same project.
