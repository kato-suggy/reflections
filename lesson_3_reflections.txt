When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are sharing with other people, or you want to make a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want control over what you are working with in your local repository, especially if other people are working on the same project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: This copies a project on GitHub into your own repository, where you can work on it without affecting the repository you forked it from.
Clones: This copies a project from GitHub to your computer, or from your computer to another location on your computer. Maybe you want to clone from GitHub and then commit your changes to the same repository.
Branch: This is when you are working on your local repository and want to try something out to be merged later, or start developing a different version of a project.
